I'd recommend un-nesting the if statements and function.
I would also recommend using more contextual or "obvious" variable names that describe their contained values or use case.
Here are some refactoring/optimization steps I took below and I've attached a file with some implementation.

* renamed orgArr global variable to letters
* renamed memValues global variable to pair

tiles_flipped variable is never declared, yet it is assigned
* declared tiles_flipped variable using let initialized it to 0

There are 2 variables named output
* initialized first output variable in starBoard() function as a let instead of var
* renamed first output variable in starBoard() function to tileDiv 
* deleted resetGame() function containing second output variable. resetGame() function is redundant so I just returned "Congrats" string literal at the end of the function.
* renamed flipBack() function argument val to letter
* moved flipBack() function out of flipper() function
* refactored flipBack() function. Removed redundant assignments
